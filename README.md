## About

The main purpose of the website is to provide a place to host local and interschool competitive programming competitions for highschoolers. 

## Competitions

### Intraschool
The CS club has hosted informal competitive programming competitions at Suncoast before that didn't require as much planning. But, even grading submissions on such a small scale required a lot of effort. In the future, the CS club site will be used for these school competitions allowing us to grade submissions and handle users in a streamlined way. 

### Interschool
The chief reason for the site is to handle an interschool competition between schools in Palm Beach School District (PBSD). There are some notable competitive programming competitions in Florida (like [UCF's HSPT](https://hspt.ucfprogrammingteam.org/)), but there are no major ones in PBSD. This competition would also be organized by highschool students, for highschool students. Hosting it earlier, without a dedicated website, was too logistically challenging. The website will allow us to run a large scale competition and continue in future years.
